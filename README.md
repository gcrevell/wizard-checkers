# Welcome to Wizard Checkers!

Welcome, oh humble one, to Wizard Checkers!! Play, if you dare, to see if you can defeat the fabled checkers Wizard!

The Wizard is so skilled at playing, he can often make moves that defy logic (and gravity!). To beat him, you will need to be equiped with skill, knowledge, luck, and some snacks. 

If you win, you will walk away with the knowledge that you can defeat the most powerful checkers player in the history of ever!

However, play at your own peral. If you lose, you will forfit your life! Or maybe some of those snacks... The Wizard is hungry.

So play, mere mortal! Challenge the great and powerful Wizard!

To run the game, ensure you have ruby installed on your computer (The Wizard likes his gems) and while in the directory containing all the files run 

		`$ ruby WizardCheckers.rb`
